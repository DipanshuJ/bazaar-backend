This Project is separated into 3 repos. This repo is the top level repo that houses the Backend Module that will handle request from all platforms .
It is built with NodeJS, ExpressJS, MySQL as a DataBase. 
Overall, the project is very similar to shopify's architecture.

The other two repos are:
1. [Bazaar-android](https://github.com/adarsh-rawat/bazaar): houses the Frotend for Admin View.
2. [Bazaar- Web](https://github.com/Mit2561/Bazzar-web): consists of both fronted+backend for public view (or customer's view).
